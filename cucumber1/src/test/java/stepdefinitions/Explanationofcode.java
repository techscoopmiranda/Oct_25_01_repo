 * 1. Feature File (amazon.feature)
 ----------------------
Purpose: This is where you define your test scenarios in Gherkin syntax. Each scenario outlines the steps that will be executed.
Connection: The steps defined in this file reference the step definitions found in the Java classes (like SignInSteps, SearchSteps, etc.). Cucumber reads this file to know what actions to perform and what outcomes to check.

2. Step Definition Classes
-------
a. SignInSteps.java
Purpose: Contains the steps related to the sign-in process.
Connection:
The methods in this class are mapped to the corresponding steps in the feature file using annotations like @Given, @When, and @Then.
This class interacts with the WebDriver to perform actions on the Amazon sign-in page (like entering credentials and clicking buttons).
b. SearchSteps.java
Purpose: Handles steps related to searching for products on Amazon.
Connection:
Similar to SignInSteps, this class contains methods linked to the steps in the feature file for searching products and verifying the title.
It uses the WebDriver to find the search box, perform searches, and validate the results.
c. DashboardSteps.java
Purpose: This class can be expanded for additional dashboard-related actions but is currently empty.
Connection: It is set up to potentially handle scenarios that involve interactions or validations on the dashboard after signing in.

3. Hooks.java
------------------
Purpose: Manages the setup and teardown processes for tests.
Connection:
The @Before annotation initializes the WebDriver before any scenario runs, ensuring a fresh browser instance.
The @After annotation closes the WebDriver after each scenario to free up resources.
The driver variable in Hooks is static and accessible in other step definition classes (like SearchSteps), allowing for shared access to the same WebDriver instance.
Overall Flow
Execution Starts: When you run your Cucumber tests, it begins by reading the amazon.feature file.
Step Mapping: Cucumber identifies the steps in the feature file and maps them to the methods in the step definition classes based on the annotations.
Method Execution:
Each method in the step definition classes executes in the order defined in the feature file.
SignInSteps handles user login, followed by SearchSteps executing the product search.
WebDriver Management: The Hooks class manages the lifecycle of the WebDriver, ensuring it is properly initialized and closed.
